# Designing-and-Implementing-a-Private-Network-using-VPC

**Designing and Implementing a Private Network using AWS VPC:**  <br>

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure, scalable, and isolated private network architecture using Amazon Web  <br>
Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The setup ensures efficient traffic routing, secure remote access, and controlled internet exposure  <br>
for EC2 instances through strategic subnet design and access control mechanisms.  <br>
