# Designing-and-Implementing-a-Private-Network-using-VPC

**Designing and Implementing a Private Network using AWS VPC:**  <br>

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure, scalable, and isolated private network architecture using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The setup ensures efficient traffic routing, secure remote access, and controlled internet exposure for EC2 instances through strategic subnet design and access control mechanisms.  <br>

**Key Components and Implementation**

 • *Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):*
    - Designed a custom VPC with CIDR block allocation to logically isolate network resources.
    - Created both public and private subnets to separate externally exposed and internal workloads.
• *Subnets & Route Tables:*
    - Configured separate route tables for public and private subnets to control traffic flow.
    - Enabled communication between subnets and managed routing to the internet where applicable.
• *Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway:*
    - Attached an Internet Gateway to the public subnet to allow internet traffic.
    - Set up a NAT Gateway to allow instances in the private subnet to access the internet without exposing them publicly.
• *EC2 Instances:*
    - Deployed an EC2 instance in the private subnet for secure and isolated computing.
    - Used AMIs, security groups, and IAM roles as per security and access requirements.
• *Bastion Host (Jump Box):*
    - Launched a Bastion Host in the public subnet to act as a secure bridge for accessing private instances.
    - Configured SSH key-based access, restricting remote access only via the Bastion Host to enhance security.
